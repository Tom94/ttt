# terminal typing test

**ttt** is a terminal program to test your typing speed, written in C++.
Supports code (auto indentation) and unicode (all languages of the world).

## How to run

Simply pipe the text you'd like to type into `ttt`.

Or generate a random typing test:
- **Quotes:** `ttt -q` picks a random quote from the included list (courtesy of [tt](https://github.com/lemnos/tt))
- **Words:** `ttt -n 20` picks 20 random words from the included list (courtesy of [tt](https://github.com/lemnos/tt))
- **AI:** a language model generates text, e.g., via [aichat](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat).
```bash
$ aichat "Short poetic paragraph about space travel." | ttt --wrap 80
```
```

void stretched endless and dark. We sailed on.

### Options

- `-q`, `--quote [LISTNAME]` to use a random quote [optional: name of quote list (default: en)]
- `-n`, `--nwords N [LISTNAME]` to generate `N` random words [optional: name of word list (default: 1000en)]
- `-t`, `--tab WIDTH` to set the tab width (default: 4)
- `-w`, `--wrap WIDTH` to word wrap to the given width (default: wrap to terminal width)
- `-h`, `--help` to show help info
- `-v`, `--version` to show version info

## How to build

This project uses CMake and has otherwise no dependencies.
To download and build it, run the following commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tom94/ttt
$ cmake -B build
$ cmake --build build
```

## How it was made

I wanted to play around with AI-assisted coding and creating **ttt** seemed like a fun way to do it.
Ergo: this project was mostly written by AI, with me stepping in just to fix a bug here and there, but mostly just prompting away.
It's amazing how far AI has come!

I used [neovim](https://neovim.io/) with the [avante plugin](https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim), but if you're not already in the vim ecosystem, you can do the same in [cursor](https://www.cursor.com/).

## TODO

- [ ] Better (configurable?) colors
- [ ] Windows support
- [ ] Squash bugs as they appear

## Shoutouts

- [aichat](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat): the perfect companion to **ttt**.
- [unilib](https://github.com/ufal/unilib): for making unicode handling a breeze.
- [tt](https://github.com/lemnos/tt): another terminal typing test. **ttt** is inspired by **tt** and uses its word and quote lists.
